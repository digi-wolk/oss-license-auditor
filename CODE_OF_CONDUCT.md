# Project Name Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Project Name community, we pledge to create a welcoming and inclusive environment
for everyone involved. We value the participation of all individuals, regardless of their background, experience level,
gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristics.

We expect all participants in our community to adhere to the following code of conduct when interacting with others:

## Be Respectful and Inclusive

Treat all individuals with respect and kindness. Be considerate of different perspectives and experiences. Engage in
constructive and empathetic discussions, and avoid derogatory or offensive language or behavior.

## Foster Collaboration and Open Communication

Encourage collaboration and cooperation among community members. Value the contributions and opinions of others, even
when they differ from your own. Foster an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas, asking
questions, and seeking help.

## Be Mindful of Language and Conduct

Refrain from using any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory language or conduct. This includes, but is not
limited to, personal attacks, insults, unwelcome advances, and offensive jokes or comments. Remember that our community
comprises diverse individuals, and any behavior that alienates or makes others feel uncomfortable is unacceptable.

## Respect Privacy and Confidentiality

Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. Do not share personal or sensitive information without explicit
permission. Be cautious when discussing topics that may be considered private or confidential.

## Resolve Conflicts Gracefully

In the event of a disagreement or conflict, engage in respectful dialogue and seek resolution in a constructive manner.
Refrain from personal attacks or inflammatory behavior. If necessary, seek assistance from community moderators or
project maintainers to help mediate and find a resolution.

maintainers immediately. You can reach out to the maintainers by initiating a private conversation with the repository
owner on [pooyan.info/contact](https://pooyan.info/contact) website.

All reports will be reviewed and treated with confidentiality. The project maintainers are dedicated to enforcing this
code of conduct and ensuring a safe and inclusive environment for all participants.
